              >Since raw eggs are used in this recipe, you must be very careful
              and use fresh eggs.<br />
              Separate the yolks from the egg whites and mix the yolks with the
              sugar until the sugar is completely melted and the composition
              becomes creamy.<br />
              If you have a problem with raw eggs you can beat the eggs on a
              steam bath.</font

              >Add the mascarpone and mix with a spatula until incorporated into
              the egg mixture. Also now we add Amaretto liqueur in the
              composition or Marsala wine, but if the children will eat or you
              know that you are going to get behind the wheel, you can give up
              this stage. If you don't have Amaretto or Marsala you can deviate
              from the classic recipe and you can even use whiskey cream, coffee
              liqueur, or whatever you think would suit.

            We quickly dip the biscuits in the coffee, if we keep them longer they will soak in the coffee and 
            we will not get the perfect dessert.

                For a perfect taste it is important to use a quality cocoa. Refrigerate overnight, then we can cut it into cubes,
                 with a sharp knife, which we will wipe before each slice.
